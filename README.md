# Deep-Learning-A-Z-Hands-On-Artificial-Neural-Networks

In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:

- Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
- Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
- Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices
- Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud
- Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System
- Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the Netflix $1 Million prize
